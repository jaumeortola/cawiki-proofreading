# cawiki-proofreading

This projecte contains several tools aimed at proofreading the whole Catalan wikipedia. The ideas and scripts used for Catalana can be easily adapted for other languages.

## Requirements & setup

## Simple replacements

## Errors that can be corrected always automatically. 
Important remarrs: You must be absolutely sure that it is always fine to apply the correction. This implies that you don't change words in other languages (in Catalan, we have to take care specially of words in Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian) or in non-standard language (old or dialectal).

## Frequent errors that need supervision

## Fixing errors with LanguageTool

### Analysis of the Wikimedia dump with LanguageTool
### Extracting and sorting errors
### Supervising errors
### Appliying the corrections
